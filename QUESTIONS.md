# Multiple-Choice Questions

## 1. REST API Best Practices

1. **What is the most appropriate HTTP status code to return when a resource is successfully created?**
   - [ ] 200  
   - [x] 201  
   - [ ] 202  
   - [ ] 204  

2. **Which of these HTTP methods is not typically idempotent?**
   - [ ] GET  
   - [x] POST  
   - [ ] PUT  
   - [ ] DELETE  

3. **Which HTTP status code best represents a successful DELETE operation with no content to return?**
   - [ ] 200  
   - [x] 204  
   - [ ] 400  
   - [ ] 404  

4. **Which practice is NOT recommended in REST API design?**
   - [ ] Use plural nouns for resources.  
   - [ ] Include version numbers in the URL.  
   - [x] Use GET for all operations.  
   - [ ] Return detailed error messages.  

5. **Which approach is best for adding filtering in a REST API without overloading the server?**
   - [x] Use query parameters for filters.  
   - [ ] Load all data on the client side and filter.  
   - [ ] Implement full-text search on every field.  
   - [ ] Separate endpoints for each filter.  

6. **In designing a REST API, which of these is a recommended practice for error handling?**
   - [ ] Return status code 500 for all errors.  
   - [x] Use descriptive error codes and messages.  
   - [ ] Only return generic error messages to the client.  
   - [ ] Avoid returning error codes, only messages.  

7. **What is the primary purpose of pagination in API design?**
   - [ ] To simplify frontend development.  
   - [ ] To handle filtering of resources.  
   - [x] To manage large datasets and reduce server load.  
   - [ ] To improve data integrity.  

8. **Which approach would best ensure that a REST API remains responsive under heavy load?**
   - [ ] Increase database connection pool size.  
   - [x] Implement rate limiting to control incoming requests.  
   - [ ] Shift all endpoints to synchronous processing.  
   - [ ] Remove pagination to reduce server processing time.

## 2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Concepts

1. **Which of the following best describes the “least privilege” principle in RBAC?**
   - [ ] Allowing users to access all resources.  
   - [x] Granting users access only to resources necessary for their role.  
   - [ ] Allowing only administrators to access all resources.  
   - [ ] Restricting all users to read-only access.  

2. **What is a practical approach to enforcing role-based access control in a REST API?**
   - [ ] Embed role information in each payload.  
   - [ ] Check roles in each endpoint individually.  
   - [x] Centralize role checks with middleware.  
   - [ ] Store roles in environment variables.  

3. **In designing RBAC for a REST API, which approach is generally more scalable and maintainable?**
   - [ ] Implement role checks directly within each route handler.  
   - [x] Define access control policies in a central middleware or authorization service.  
   - [ ] Use a separate role for every unique endpoint combination.  
   - [ ] Allow each endpoint to specify its own roles and permissions without central oversight.

## 3. GCP and Cloud Knowledge

1. **Which GCP service is best suited for hosting containerized applications?**
   - [ ] Firebase  
   - [ ] Firestore  
   - [ ] Cloud Functions  
   - [x] Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  

2. **What is a primary advantage of using Google Cloud Run for a serverless deployment?**
   - [ ] Persistent data storage.  
   - [x] Automatically scales based on request load.  
   - [ ] Fixed pricing model regardless of usage.  
   - [ ] No requirement for containerization.  

3. **Which Google Cloud service is best for handling asynchronous messaging between services?**
   - [x] Cloud Pub/Sub  
   - [ ] Firestore  
   - [ ] GKE  
   - [ ] Cloud Run  

4. **What is Firestore’s main advantage as a database choice?**
   - [ ] Enforces strict schema.  
   - [x] Real-time sync and scalability.  
   - [ ] Native support for complex joins.  
   - [ ] Built-in role-based access.

## 4. Database Design and Best Practices

1. **In a document-based NoSQL database like Firestore, how would you best store a list of related items (e.g., a list of horse vaccinations) in a horse document?**
   - [x] Use a sub-collection within each horse document.  
   - [ ] Store the list in a relational database instead.  
   - [ ] Store each item in a separate collection at the root level.  
   - [ ] Store the list as a string field.  

2. **Which of these is a drawback of using NoSQL databases for storing highly relational data?**
   - [ ] Limited scalability.  
   - [x] Inefficiency in handling complex joins.  
   - [ ] High storage costs.  
   - [ ] Inflexible schema structure.
